## Introduction

The Maji Ndogo project focuses on auditing the water quality data recorded in the project's database. The primary goal is to verify the integrity and accuracy of the data and to address any inconsistencies found during the audit. This project is crucial for maintaining trust in the data used for decision-making and governance.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `Integrated_Project_Maji_Ndogo_Part3.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the analysis.
- `Part3_Slides.pdf`: Presentation slides summarizing the project's objectives, methods, and findings.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Notebook Overview

### Introduction
- Sets the stage for the data exploration journey.
- Provides context for the audit and the importance of data integrity.

### Generating an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)
- Understands the database structure.
- Key tables involved: `visits`, `locations`, `water_quality`, `auditor_report`.

### Integrating the Auditor's Report
- Loads and examines the auditor's report.
- Creates the `auditor_report` table in the database.

### Linking Records
- Joins the auditor's data with the existing database records to compare water quality scores.

### Gathering Evidence
- Constructs complex queries to investigate discrepancies.
- Compares subjective quality scores with independently measured scores from the auditor.

## Setup and Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL database (or any SQL database that supports the required operations)
- Required Python libraries: pandas, sqlalchemy, and mysql-connector-python

### Installation

You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python
```

Ensure that you have access to the database and the necessary credentials to connect and execute queries.

## Data Description

The primary data sources include:

- **visits**: Logs of visits to different water source locations.
- **locations**: Details of each water source location.
- **water_quality**: Records of water quality scores.
- **auditor_report**: Independent audit report containing re-examined water quality scores and statements from locals.

## Analysis and Findings

### Comparing Scores
- The notebook extracts and compares scores from the `water_quality` table and the `auditor_report`.
- Identifies patterns and discrepancies between the two sets of scores.

### Identifying Issues
- Some data was found to be tampered with, requiring immediate attention.
- Highlights areas for improvement in data entry and validation processes.

## Conclusion

The audit confirmed that while the majority of the data aligns with good governance principles, there are some discrepancies that need to be addressed. The findings underscore the importance of regular audits and continuous improvement in data management practices.
